# spatiotemporal-data-summer-2023
My submission for the Spatiotemporal Data class. 

This is an analysis of Soil Water Content (SWC) and Ecosystem Respiration (RECO) data from the [FLUXNET](https://fluxnet.org/) network.

The dataset consists of time series data from FLUXNET, which measures various ecological parameters, including Soil Water Content (SWC) and Ecosystem Respiration (RECO). FLUXNET data is typically collected from multiple stations, each providing measurements at different levels (e.g., soil, canopy, etc.).
